`git pull` brings the changes from the remote repository into yours.
It does not merge across branches.
So if there are new changes on master and you are working on the myBranch branch,
you may want to merge master into myBranch.

How do you know what will change?
  Do it and abort if there are problems? (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5817579/how-can-i-preview-a-merge-in-git)
