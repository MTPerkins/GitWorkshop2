```
try to split your work into small steps from the very beginning. It is always easier to squash a few commits together than to    split one big commit into several
```
```
They should be consistent, working
       independently of any later commits, pass the test suite, etc. This makes the
       review process much easier, and the history much more useful for later
       inspection and analysis

```
merging works at the branch level, while cherry-picking  works at the commit level.
... scales much better to a large number of contributors
... merges require a more careful branch   management.
